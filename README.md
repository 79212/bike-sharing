## Installation
The code requires Python versions of 3.* and general libraries available through the Anaconda package.

## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>


#### How do tree-based ensemble models compare when predicting bike sharing demand?

To answer this question I used three different algorithms:
* AdaBoost
* Random Forests
* XGBoost

I used three different performance metrics:
* MAE (mean average error)
* RMSE (root mean squared error)
* RMSLE (root mean squared log error)

## File Description <a name="description"></a>
This project includes one Jupyter notebook with all code required for analyzing the data and creating a supervised machine learning algorithm.

## Results
The main findings of the analysis will be published on [Medium](https://medium.com/@julia.nikulski). A short overview of the results shall be given here:

The data used for the analysis comes from:
* [Capital Bike Share](http://capitalbikeshare.com/system-data): this includes the bike demand data for the metro DC area
* [NOAA's National Climatic Data Center](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/search): this includes the weather data for the metro DC area
* [DC Department of Human Resources](http://dchr.dc.gov/page/holiday-schedule): this includes the holiday data for Washington, D.C.

Feel free to use the code as you please and play around with it.
